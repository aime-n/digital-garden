## Essential Concepts

1. **Patterns**
   1. *White Noise*: White noise refers to random and uncorrelated fluctuations in data, often seen as the absence of any discernible patterns or trends.
   2. *Cyclicity*: Cyclicity in time series data refers to recurring patterns or cycles that are not strictly periodic. These patterns may have varying lengths.
   3. *Seasonality*: Seasonality describes the regular, predictable patterns or variations in data that occur at fixed intervals, often related to calendar seasons.
   4. *Trend*: A trend is a long-term movement or direction in time series data, typically characterized by a consistent increase or decrease over time.

2. **Frequency**
   Frequency in time series analysis refers to the number of observations or data points collected within a specific time interval. It is a measure of how often data is recorded, such as daily, monthly, or annually.
