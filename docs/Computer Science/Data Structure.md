## Mini Wiki: Data Structures

### Introduction
Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and manipulating data on a computer. They are essential for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, enabling developers to write efficient algorithms.

### Fundamental Data Structures

#### 1. **Arrays:**
   - **Definition:** Fixed-size, sequential collection of elements of the same type.
   - **Use Cases:** Quick access to elements based on index, small and constant size lists.
   - **Complexity:** Constant time access, linear time insertion and deletion.

#### 2. **Linked Lists:**
   - **Definition:** Collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
   - **Use Cases:** Dynamic size lists, constant time insertions and deletions.
   - **Types:** Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.

#### 3. **Stacks:**
   - **Definition:** Collection of elements with Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
   - **Use Cases:** Undo mechanisms, parsing expressions, depth-first search.
   - **Operations:** Push, Pop, Peek.

#### 4. **Queues:**
   - **Definition:** Collection of elements with First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
   - **Use Cases:** Order processing, breadth-first search.
   - **Types:** Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Dequeue.

#### 5. **Hash Tables:**
   - **Definition:** Collection of key-value pairs with a hash function mapping keys to indices.
   - **Use Cases:** Quick lookups, de-duplication, frequency counting.

#### 6. **Trees:**
   - **Definition:** Hierarchical data structure with a root element and connected nodes.
   - **Use Cases:** Hierarchical data representation, sorting, searching.
   - **Types:** Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree.

#### 7. **Graphs:**
   - **Definition:** Collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
   - **Use Cases:** Network representation, social networks, routing algorithms.
   - **Types:** Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted.

#### 8. **Matrices:**
   - **Definition:** Two-dimensional array with rows and columns.
   - **Use Cases:** Graph representation, image processing, mathematical calculations.

### Advanced Data Structures:

#### 1. **Heaps:**
   - **Definition:** Specialized tree-based structure satisfying the heap property.
   - **Use Cases:** Priority queues, heap sort.

#### 2. **Tries:**
   - **Definition:** Tree-like structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings.
   - **Use Cases:** Auto-complete suggestions, IP routing.

#### 3. **B-Trees and B+ Trees:**
   - **Definition:** Balanced tree data structure maintaining sorted data and allowing searches, insertions, and deletions.
   - **Use Cases:** File systems, databases.

### Conclusion
Data structures are foundational to computer science and programming, playing a crucial role in designing efficient software. Understanding when and how to use different data structures is key to writing efficient and effective algorithms and software solutions. Each data structure offers specific advantages and is suited to particular tasks, and choosing the right one for the job is a critical skill for developers and programmers.
