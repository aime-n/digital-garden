The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, also known as the Mann-Whitney U Test, is a nonparametric statistical test used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between two independent groups or samples. 

In essence, this test assesses whether the two groups have similar distributions or whether one tends to have consistently higher or lower values compared to the other. It accomplishes this by ranking all the values from both groups together, then summing the ranks of one group, and comparing this sum to the expected sum under the null hypothesis (which assumes no difference between groups).

The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test is particularly useful when dealing with ordinal, skewed, or non-normally distributed data and when the assumptions of parametric tests like the t-test cannot be met. It is widely used in various fields, including biology, social sciences, and clinical research, to compare groups in situations where a simple comparison of means might not be appropriate or valid.
