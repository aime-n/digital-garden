Descriptive statistics are a set of techniques used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. These statistics provide a concise overview of the data, allowing researchers and analysts to understand its central tendencies, variations, and distribution. Descriptive statistics do not involve making inferences or drawing conclusions about a larger population; instead, they focus on characterizing the sample data itself. Here are some common descriptive statistics:

1. **Measures of Central Tendency:**
   - **[[Mean]] (Average):** The sum of all values in the dataset divided by the number of observations. It represents the "typical" value in the dataset.
   - **[[Median]]:** The middle value in a sorted dataset. It is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.
   - **[[Mode]]:** The value(s) that occur most frequently in the dataset.

2. **Measures of Dispersion (Variability):**
   - **Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides an idea of the data's spread.
   - **Variance:** A measure of how much individual data points deviate from the mean. It quantifies the spread of data.
   - **[[Standard Deviation]]:** The square root of the variance. It measures the average deviation of data points from the mean.
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile). It is useful for understanding the spread of data while being less affected by extreme values.

3. **Measures of Shape and Distribution:**
   - **[[Skewness]]:** Indicates the asymmetry of the data distribution. Positive skewness means the distribution is skewed to the right, while negative skewness means it's skewed to the left.
   - **[[Kurtosis]]:** Measures the "tailedness" or peakedness of the data distribution. High kurtosis indicates heavy tails, while low kurtosis indicates light tails.

4. **Frequency Distribution:**
   - **Histogram:** A graphical representation of the data's distribution, showing the frequency of values within specified bins.
   - **Frequency Table:** A tabular summary of data values along with their respective frequencies.

5. **Percentiles and Quartiles:**
   - **Percentiles:** Values that divide the data into 100 equal parts (e.g., the 25th percentile is the value below which 25% of the data falls).
   - **Quartiles:** Values that divide the data into four equal parts (e.g., the first quartile is the 25th percentile, the second quartile is the median, and the third quartile is the 75th percentile).

6. **Summary Statistics:**
   - **Count:** The number of observations in the dataset.
   - **Sum:** The total of all values in the dataset.
   - **Mean, Median, Mode (as mentioned above):** Central tendency measures.
   - **Variance, Standard Deviation (as mentioned above):** Measures of variability.

Descriptive statistics are an essential first step in data analysis. They provide a basic understanding of the dataset's characteristics, which can help identify trends, outliers, and patterns, guiding further analysis and decision-making.
