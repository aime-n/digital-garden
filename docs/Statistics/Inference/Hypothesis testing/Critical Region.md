The **critical region**, also known as the **rejection region**, is a concept in hypothesis testing in statistics. It represents the set of values of a test statistic that leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis. In other words, _when the test statistic falls within the critical region, it indicates that the observed data is so extreme that it is unlikely to have occurred by random chance_, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
