   3. *Seasonality*: Seasonality describes the regular, predictable patterns or variations in data that occur at fixed intervals, often related to calendar seasons.
   4. *[[Trends]]*: A trend is a long-term movement or direction in time series data, typically characterized by a consistent increase or decrease over time.
