# Median

The **median** is a statistical measure commonly used to describe the **central tendency of a dataset**. It is one of the three main measures of central tendency, alongside the mean (average) and mode (most frequent value).

## Definition

The median is defined as the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in either ascending or descending order. In cases where there is an even number of data points, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values.

## Robustness

One of the key advantages of the median is its robustness. Unlike the mean, which is sensitive to extreme outliers, the median provides a measure of central location that is resistant to extreme values. This makes it particularly useful when dealing with skewed data or data that does not follow a normal distribution.

## Applications

The median is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, healthcare, and social sciences. It helps researchers and analysts gain insights into the typical or central value of a dataset without being unduly influenced by extreme observations.
