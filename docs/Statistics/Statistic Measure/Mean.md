# Mean

The **mean**, often referred to as the *average*, is a fundamental statistical measure used to _describe the central tendency_ of a dataset.

## Definition

The mean is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and then dividing that sum by the number of values in the dataset. It is represented mathematically as:


## Common Usage

The mean provides a measure of central location that is sensitive to all values in the dataset. It is particularly useful when dealing with data that follows a normal distribution or when a simple, overall summary of data is needed.

$Mean (Î¼)$ = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

## Variations

There are different types of means, including:

- **Arithmetic Mean**: The standard mean calculated as described above.
- **Geometric Mean**: Used for exponential growth and calculating the average of rates.
- **Harmonic Mean**: Used for averaging rates or ratios.
- **Weighted Mean**: Allows assigning different weights to values based on their importance.

## Limitations

While the mean is a powerful measure, it can be sensitive to extreme values, making it less suitable for datasets with outliers or skewed distributions. In such cases, the median may be a more appropriate measure of central tendency.
