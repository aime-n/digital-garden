**Key Concepts:**

- **Random Sampling:** To ensure that a sample is representative of the population, random sampling methods are often employed. This involves selecting individuals or items from the population in a way that each has an equal chance of being chosen.
    
- **Sampling Error:** The difference between a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) and the corresponding population parameter is known as sampling error. It's important to recognize that samples may not perfectly reflect the population, and some degree of error is inherent in sampling.
    
- **Inferential Statistics:** The process of making inferences about a population based on the information gathered from a sample is known as inferential statistics. It involves using statistical methods to draw conclusions and make predictions.
