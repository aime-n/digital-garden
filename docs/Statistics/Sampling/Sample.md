**2. Sample:**

- **Definition:** A sample is a subset of the population, selected in a systematic or random way, with the aim of representing the characteristics of the entire population. Sampling involves choosing a smaller group of observations from the population for the purpose of analysis.

- **Examples:** 
  - In a survey, a group of 500 randomly selected adults from a country's population represents a sample.
  - Quality control in manufacturing might involve testing a random sample of 100 items from a larger production run.

- **Characteristics:**
  - Samples are typically smaller than populations but should be large enough to provide meaningful results.
  - Statistical techniques are used to make inferences about the population based on the data collected from the sample.

- **Use in Statistics:** Samples are used to estimate population parameters, test hypotheses, and draw conclusions about the population without having to study or measure every individual or element within it.
